# apple-jsonb-project

This project demonstrates Java objects being serialized accross the network in JSON format.
It imitates an Apple online store with apple products, a customer, an order and that creates an order's details
that comprises of all these components.  

In order to have a functional store our products require the following actors:
- Products
- Customers
- Users
- Order Details
- Order

The objective is to create a shopping cart with details of products and customers who purchased those products.
You can find the order.txt file in the project's root directory. This is the file that returns 
the Java objects into JSON format. You can validate the JSON file with any JSON validator of choice 
to communicate with the API.
